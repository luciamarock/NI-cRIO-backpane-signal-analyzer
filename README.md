NI cRIO backpane cseries modules signal analyzer

This is a signal analyzer for signals generated by National Instruments cSeries IO modules for cRIO chassis.  The Python program estimates a few parameters such as: 

- signal amplitude  
- fft bins length 
- frequency of the peak 
- amplitude of the frequency peak 
- ENOB  

Code needs a textual input file for working. In my case the input file where generated directly from a LabVIEW vi for data acquisition of the cRIO IO chassis.
